  annote = {ABSTRACT=The objective of this study was to develop a unique scientific
	methodology as well as a practical tool for designing the loading
	pattern (LP) and burnable poison (BP) pattern for a given Pressurized
	Water Reactor (PWR) core. Because of the large number of possible
	combinations for the fuel assembly (FA) loading in the core, the
	design of the core configuration is a complex optimization problem.
	It requires finding an optimal FA arrangement and corresponding BP
	placement design that will achieve maximum cycle length while satisfying
	the safety constraints. To solve this optimization problem, a core
	reload optimization package, GARCO (Genetic Algorithm Reactor Code
	Optimization) code is developed. This code is applicable for all
	types of PWR cores having different geometries and designs with an
	unlimited number of FA types in the inventory. GARCO has three modes:
	the user can optimize the core configuration (LP pattern) with or
	without BPs in the first mode; the second mode is the optimization
	of BP placement in the core and the last mode is the user can optimize
	LP and BP placements simultaneously in mode 3. In this study, the
	first mode finds the optimal LPs using the Haling Power Depletion
	Method (HPD) for placing BPs in the core. The second mode, which
	depletes the core accurately, places BPs in the selected optimum
	LP pattern. This methodology is applied only to the TMI-1 PWR. However,
	the improved Mode 1 GA option was applied to both the VVER-1000 and
	the TMI-1 to demonstrate and verify the advantages of the new enhancements
	in optimizing the LP pattern only. The ``Moby-Dick'' code is used
	as reactor physics code for VVER-1000 analysis in this research.
	The SIMULATE-3 code, which is an advanced two-group nodal code, is
	used to analyze the TMI-1. The libraries of the BP designs used in
	SIMULATE-3 in this study were produced by Yilmaz.},

	optimization of loading pattern and burnable poison placement for
	the TMI-1 reactor},

  pages = {113--120},

  annote = {ABSTRACT=In this paper, the GARCO–PSU (Genetic Algorithm Reactor
	Code Optimization–Pennsylvania State University) code simultaneously
	optimizes the core loading pattern (LP) and the burnable poison (BP)
	placement in a pressurized water reactor (PWR). The LP optimization
	and BP placement optimization are interconnected, but it is difficult
	to solve the combined problem due to its large size. Separating the
	problem into two sequential steps provides a practical way to solve
	the problem. However, the result of this method alone may not develop
	the real optimal solution. GARCO–PSU achieves solving the LP optimization
	and BP placement optimization simultaneously by developing an innovative
	genetic algorithm (GA). The classical representation of the genotype
	has been modified to incorporate in-core fuel management basic knowledge.
	GARCO has three modes; the first mode optimizes the LP only, the
	second mode optimizes the LP and BP placement in sequence. The third
	mode, which optimizes the LP and BP placement simultaneously, is
	described in this paper. GARCO, as stated in Part I, can be applied
	to all types of PWR core structures having different geometries with
	an unlimited number of fuel assembly (FA) types in the inventory.},

	The Haling power depletion method for in-core fuel management analysis},
  journal = {Annals of Nuclear Energy},
  year = {2008},
  volume = {35},
  pages = {121--131},
  number = {1},
  annote = {ABSTRACT=The Haling Power Distribution (HPD) has been applied in
	a unique process to greatly accelerate the in-core fuel management
	optimization calculations. These calculations involve; the arrangement
	of fuel assemblies (FAs) and the placement of Burnable Poisons (BPs)
	in the fresh FAs. The HPD deals only with the arrangement of FAs.
	The purpose of this paper is to describe past uses of the HPD, provide
	an example selected from many similar calculations to explain why
	and how it can be used, and also to show its effectiveness as a filter
	in the GARCO GA code. The GARCO (Genetic Algorithm Reactor Core Optimization)
	is an innovative GA code that was developed by modifying the classical
	representation of the genotype and GA operators. A reactor physics
	code evaluates the LPs in the population using the HPD Method, which
	rapidly depletes the core in a single depletion step with a constant
	power distribution. The HPD is used basically in GARCO as a filter
	to eliminate invalid LPs created by the genetic operators, to choose
	a reference LP for BP optimization, and to create an initial population
	for simultaneous optimization of the LP and BP placement into the
	core. The accurate depletion calculation of the LP with BPs is done
	with the coupled lattice and reactor physics CASMO-4/SIMULATE3 package.
	However, the fact that these codes validate safety of the core with
	the added BP placement design also validates the use of the HPD method.
	The calculations are applied to the TMI-1 core as an example PWR
	providing concrete results.},

	the optimization of reload patterns for Boiling Water Reactors (BWR).
	The system uses the basic GA operators, crossover, mutation and selection
	over the loading pattern (LP) represented by a combination of fresh
	and burned fuel assemblies, as well as an objective function taking
	into account cycle length and radial peaking factor, to obtain improved
	loading patterns compared with real BWR loadings. The system takes
	advantage of the efficient quarter core two dimensional (2D) calculations,
	using the Haling technique to perform thousands of LPs evaluations
	and obtain the better candidates in a reasonably computer processor
	(CPU) time. },

  abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton�Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations
	of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear
	equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction
	equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector
	product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing
	the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various
	approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning
	the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear
	problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given
	problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential
	for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial
	differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this
	survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution
	algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value
	problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK
	and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options
	available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator)
	around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning
	process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this
	paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide
	proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent
	methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how
	JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide
	sources of further practical information.},

	development is required, the GA promises to outperform SA in this
	application, particularly in a parallel processing environment. \\
	ANNOTE: The authors implement GA in FORMOSA, which uses GPT for the
	physics. They compare the CX, PMX, and HCMX crossover operators.
	HCMX appears to be the Heuristic Tie-Breaking Crossover described
	in other works, but they don't offer details. A key takeaway from
	their plots is that GA dove more quickly to a better evaluation but
	also stagnates whereas SA exhibits a steadier descent. This would
	seem to suggest hill-climbing heuristics could be used successfully,
	at least in later generations.},

	several eigensolvers are evaluated for this inner problem, using

	both the explicitly-restarted Arnoldi and the Krylov-Schur methods

  annote = {How to `refuel' a nuclear power reactor, when it is shut down every
	year or so between two successive operation cycles, is the `in-core
	fuel management' problem. To solve it, it is necessary to design
	and simulate a safe and efficient fuel loading pattern. `Reload design'
	plays a crucial role in nuclear power plant operation, in terms of
	both economy and safety. This article presents FuelGen, a system
	embodying a specialized genetic algorithm for designing refuellings.
	The tests on well-researched cases have shown that the algorithm
	is capable of finding a better loading pattern-enabling the reactor
	to run both longer and more efficiently per cycle—than solutions
	reported in the domain literature and found by other methods, such
	as expert systems and simulated annealing. Over a decade, the parent-project
	Fuelcon first inaugurated the rule-driven refuelling paradigm, then
	turned to probing hybrid architectures. Its sequel, FuelGen, radically
	supersedes Fuelcon's search mechanism, while retaining the architectural
	and ergonomic outlook that Fuelcon had evolved.
