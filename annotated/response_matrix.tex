\begin{abstract}
  This is an annotated bibliography of the literature related to the eigenvalue response matrix method (ERMM), that is, the response matrix method in which responses are implicit functions of the $k$-eigenvalue.  Much of the work is related to the ``heterogeneous coarse mesh method'' developed at Georgia Tech, which for all practical purposes, can be viewed as a matrix-free application of ERMM.  Other cited works demonstrate how old the method is, though its foundations rest primarily in diffusion approximations.  Our recent work is also included.  Abstracts are given in place of or addition to our own notes.
