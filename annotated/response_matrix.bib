  abstract = {Recent work has revisited the eigenvalue response matrix method as
	an approach for reactor core analyses. In its most straightforward
	form, the method consists of a two-level eigenproblem. An outer Picard
	iteration updates the k-eigenvalue, while the inner eigenproblem
	imposes current continuity between coarse meshes. In this paper,
	several eigensolvers are evaluated for this inner problem, using
	several 2-D diffusion benchmarks as test cases. The results indicate
	both the explicitly-restarted Arnoldi and the Krylov-Schur methods
	are up to an order of magnitude more efficient than power iteration.
	This increased efficiency makes the nested eigenvalue formulation
	more effective than the ILU-preconditioned Newton-Krylov formulation
	previously studied.},

	as a technique for solving coarse mesh transport equations, and the
	classical approach of power iteration (PI) for solution is described.
	The method is then reformulated as a nonlinear system of equations,
	and the associated Jacobian is derived. A Jacobian-Free Newton-Krylov
	(JFNK) method is employed to solve the sys- tem, using an approximate
	Jacobian coupled with incomplete factorization as a preconditioner.
	The unpreconditioned JFNK slightly outperforms PI, and preconditioned
	JFNK outperforms both PI and Steffensen-accelerated PI significantly.},
