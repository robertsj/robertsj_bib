README -- robertsj_bib
----------------------

This is the BibTeX file I use for all papers and projects.  Where
applicable, I've tried to add annotations, especially for papers
related to thesis work.

Note, the director "annotated" contains one or more annotated
bibliographies.  I use JabRef as a gui to the BibTeX database.
With that, I can search a key work and export partial databases.
These are used in the .tex files, and the nice annotations
are printed using the nocite command.  The plain-annote BibTeX
style is required, but it should be widely available.
